Interactions with embedded YouTube videos and radio station streams.

Third-Party Data:

Our app integrates with third-party services that may collect data according to their respective privacy policies.

2. How We Use Your Information

3. Third-Party Services and Links

Third-Party Content Disclaimer:
Music Lingo provides access to publicly available content through third-party services, including, but not limited to, radio stations aggregated via Radio Browser and videos via the YouTube iframe API. These services are owned and operated by independent third parties over whom we exercise no control.

By using Music Lingo, you acknowledge that:

Music Lingo does not host, store, rebroadcast, or provide downloads of any third-party content, including radio station audio or video services; it only provides streaming access by linking to publicly available content.

All radio station streams, logos, and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

If any station owner or content provider wishes to have their stream or content removed from our app, they may contact us at contact.musiclingo@gmail.com, and we will promptly review and address the request.

How Streaming Works:
Music Lingo provides a list of thousands of popular radio stations worldwide for your convenience. When you play a station in the app, you are using the embedded player as a tool to access the station stream online. This works similarly to opening the stream in a web browser or a media player such as VLC. The stations themselves may collect and use your IP address based on their own privacy policies. Music Lingo does not control or have access to this data.

YouTube iframe API:
Music Lingo integrates the YouTube iframe API to display video content. YouTube may collect and process data such as viewing history and interactions with its videos. We comply with YouTube's Developer Policies and do not collect or share any data beyond what is permitted. For more information, please review YouTube's Privacy Policy. YouTube receives information when you watch embedded videos in the app.

Radio Browser API:
Our app sources radio station metadata from Radio Browser, an open-source project that provides publicly available internet radio streams. When you listen to a radio station through our app, Radio Browser receives data indicating that the station was accessed. According to Radio Browser's public terms, these streams are freely available for public use, and Music Lingo complies with their usage policies. However, station access is subject to their respective terms of service, and Music Lingo does not claim any ownership or rights over the content.

Please note that Radio Browser is a community-driven project and has publicly stated that they are not responsible for the entries on their website, as it operates similarly to Wikipedia. Music Lingo acts as an intermediary, providing access to this publicly available data without assuming responsibility for the content. We do our best to observe copyright laws and ensure compliance.

If you become aware of any copyright violations occurring on the third-party platforms we work with, please alert us at contact.musiclingo@gmail.com, and we will take action to remove the infringing content from our platform as soon as possible.

Amplitude Analytics:
We use Amplitude to analyze app usage patterns and improve the user experience. Amplitude collects anonymized data on user interactions within the app but does not track users for advertising purposes or share data with advertising platforms. For more details, please review Amplitude's Privacy Policy.

4. User Rights and Choices

You have the following rights regarding your data:

Access: You can request access to the information we collect about you.

Deletion: You may request that we delete your personal data.

Opt-Out: You can restrict data collection by discontinuing use of the app or adjusting your device settings.

5. Copyright and Intellectual Property

Music Lingo respects the intellectual property rights of all third-party content providers. Any trademarks, logos, and content accessed through our app remain the property of their respective owners. We do not claim any ownership or affiliation with third-party services and only provide access as a directory for publicly available content.
